Purpose
-------
This firmware demonstrates basic UART communication using memory-mapped I/O.
It is typically used in a simple RISC-V SoC or embedded system where the CPU
communicates with peripherals through fixed memory addresses.

The program performs two main tasks:
1. Prints a greeting message multiple times over UART.
2. Enters an infinite loop that echoes back any character received via UART.

Concept: Memory-Mapped I/O
--------------------------
In many embedded systems and SoCs, hardware peripherals (UART, SPI, GPIO, etc.)
are accessed through specific memory addresses. Reading or writing to these
addresses directly controls the hardware.

Example:
Writing to UART_TX register sends a character over the serial interface.
Reading from UART_RX register retrieves a received character.

 UART Register Mapping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These macros map UART hardware registers to specific memory addresses.

The 'volatile' keyword is critical here. It tells the compiler that the value
at this memory location may change due to hardware activity, so it must not
optimize away reads or writes.

Without 'volatile', the compiler might cache values in registers and break
hardware communication.

/* UART transmit register
   Writing a byte to this address sends it through the UART transmitter */
#define UART_TX      (*(volatile char*)0x10000000)

/* UART receive register
   Reading from this address retrieves the received byte from UART */
#define UART_RX      (*(volatile char*)0x10000004)

/* UART status register
   Used to check if data is available or if the transmitter is ready */

 Function: uart_putc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
    Send a single character over UART.

Parameter:
    c : character to transmit

Operation:
    Writing the character to the UART transmit register triggers the
    hardware UART module to send the byte serially.

Note:
    This implementation assumes the transmitter is always ready.
    More advanced UART drivers would check a TX-ready status bit first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Function: uart_puts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
    Send a null-terminated string over UART.

Parameter:
    s : pointer to a string

Operation:
    The function loops through each character of the string until the
    null terminator ('\0') is reached, sending each character using
    uart_putc().

Example:
    uart_puts("Hello\n");

This is a common pattern in embedded firmware for printing debug messages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Function: uart_getc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose:
    Receive one character from UART.

Operation:
    This function performs a blocking read. It continuously checks the
    UART status register until a character is available.

UART_STATUS & 0x2:
    Bit 1 is assumed to indicate that receive data is available.

Process:
    1. Poll the UART_STATUS register.
    2. Wait until RX-ready bit becomes set.
    3. Read the received character from UART_RX register.

Blocking behavior:
    The CPU will remain in the loop until a character arrives.

    /* Wait until RX data available bit is set */

    Behavior:

        will be immediately transmitted back (echoed).
